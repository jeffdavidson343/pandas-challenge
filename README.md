# Analysis
In this excercise we analyzed school data in order to draw conclusions on how school spending, size, and type affect students math and reading grades.

# Conclusions
1. The top 5 schools are all charter schools, and the bottom 5 are all district schools. When comparing the per student budget of each, the district budget tends to be higher. This implies charter schools are more efficient with their budget relative to average test scores.
2. Average reading and math scores generally stay consistent from 9th to 12th grade, even when schools have a significantly higher average in one than the other.
